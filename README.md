Everything is based on an ESP32 Microcontroller. The Left button is the START button and the right one is the SELECT button. The player can rotate the encoder knob to change the angle of the cast. They can also cast using th gyro MPU. Changing the acceleration values with determine the strength of the cast. If implemented in real life, the player would just need to flick the device to cast the rod. Moving the slider up and down reels the line. A shop and gambling system is intended to be added in future updates. Also, more fish and things to catch will be added! The current version only has one catch, a normal fish! The goal of this was to program a small game that allowed the user to interact in ways that aren't normally found.
